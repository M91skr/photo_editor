## Photo Editor

## Description
In this code, I made a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that performs simple photo editing operations.
With this program, you can upload an image and perform any of the following operations on it:
- Crop
- Resize
- Rotate
- Convert (black and white / ...)
- Add text


## How to run
run following:
```bash

```



pip install pipreqs

pipreqs . --force
